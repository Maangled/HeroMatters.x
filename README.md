Content Aggregation Browser, a way to view anything on the internet in one place, at your digression

## Abstract Summary
“That’s not a question, only when you know the question will you know what the answer means.” The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy relays the idea that we don’t even know what questions we should be asking which is why we fail to grasp the meaning of existence. Computers did not exist when my parents grew up. News came through orchestrated pipelines of papers and radio. Now a child can scroll through their phone finding investment advice, math problems, and a rich culture of world news to enlighten their understanding of our tiny place on this earth. But they are not safe, or at least we fear for their safety. Our data was breached along with half of Americans by Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. Our data is optimized to keep us consuming by Google and Amazon. The operating system on our phones and computers is innately baked in with ads and bloatware and those same large monopolies receive a significant cut of any application or independent developer we try to support. Our location is being tracked by the government, through cell phone towers, constantly. Everything we do online goes through a monopolies that more interested in money than they are in helping people. On top of that, the majority of purchases we make are being tracked. This vast quantity of data is being used to manipulate us. We did not sign this social contract and yes, we would leave United States just like the revolutionaries of 1776 did to escape their oppressive government but where would we go? Live like Snowden in Russia hiding from the people we’re trying to protect? We don’t believe any individual would want creepy mass surveillance program built in the shadows. That’s why we must take our freedom online, one person at a time, finding our independence on the internet. Our project aims to combat tyranny by making a Community Guide to a Decentralized Existence i.e. The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Web 3.0 and Self-Sovereign Identity.

## Problem Statement
Our Problem is Data, or rather, who holds the data. In the book Ready Player One, people enter into a fair and honest metaverse, one where you can be anything and do anything living a life in the Oasis. The book shows the construction of the Oasis done by a team completely on camera, anyone could come and watch how it was constructed. We want that metaverse too, one that is created by angels changing the arch of humanity into a information rich web of fun things to do and projects to work on without swashbucklers harvesting our data to sell advertisements. Before we start coding our metaverse, we want to make sure the privacy of each member is respected and then adapt the latest technologies to make their lives simpler.

Content Aggregation Browser, a way to view anything on the internet in one place, at your digression

## Abstract Summary
Have you ever asked yourself what cryptocurrency would look like if it were mainstream? What if the biggest promises of crypto privacy and decentralization came true? It would not mean we abandon the government, it means we could enhance it with a new level of transparancy and efficiency. 
It would not mean money would be entirely online, but it could add an avenue of wealth growth.
It would not be limited to the rich being able to buy and manipulate the markets. Anyone, Anywhere would be able to pick up a laptop or a phone and start contributing.
It would not be taxed without our representation and we would be able to directly vote on the issues that mean the most to us.
It would not allow the tracking of our every move without our consent, it would focus on individual security first and foremost.
It would not destroy industies it would enhance and secure our workforce and our people through unionized labor.
It's time for the digial revolution.

“What's the answer to life, the universe, and everything?... That’s not a question, only when you know the question will you know what the answer means.” This line from Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy relays the idea that we don’t even know what questions we should be asking which is why we fail to grasp the meaning of our existence. Not that long ago computers did not exist. News came through orchestrated pipelines like papers and radio, then that structure was built into cable and internet. Now a child can scroll through their phone finding investment advice, math problems, and a rich culture of world news to enlighten their understanding of our tiny place on this earth. But they are not safe, or at least we fear for their safety. Our data was breached like most of Americans by Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. Our data is optimized to keep us consuming by Google and Amazon. The operating system on our phones and computers, the on with ads and bloatware are run by large monopolies who receive a significant cut of any application or independent developer we try to support. Our location is being tracked through cell phone towers by the government. Everything we do online goes through a monopolies that more interested in money than they are in helping people and there is little restriction on who can handle that data. This vast quantity of our own data is being used to manipulate us. We did not sign this social contract and yes, we would leave United States just like the revolutionaries of 1776 did to escape their oppressive government... but where would we go? We must take our freedom online, one person at a time, to find our independence on the internet. **Our project aims to combat tyranny by making a Community Guide to a Decentralized Existence i.e. The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Web 3.0 and Self-Sovereign Identity.**

## Problem Statement
Our Problem is Data, or rather, who holds the data. In the book Ready Player One, people enter into a fair and honest metaverse, one where you can be anything and do anything living a life in the Oasis. The book shows the construction of the Oasis done by a team completely on camera, anyone could come and watch how it was constructed. We want that metaverse too, one that is created by angels changing the arch of humanity into a information rich web of fun things to do and projects to work on without swashbucklers harvesting our data to sell advertisements. Before we start coding our metaverse, we want to make sure the privacy of each member is respected and then adapt the latest technologies to make their lives simpler.

## Matters 
Content Aggregation Browser, a way to view anything on the internet in one place, at your digression 

We are approaching the idea of social media with a right-to-repair metality. This means the entire app is customizable. You will be able to bring up feeds from from any media source and have them all mangled together. Personal Content Aggregation Templates will be important too. 
Information will be directly accesable from people's personal profile page, allowing hosting of content to be centralized around the origional poster and be shared in a decentralized manner.

### 2. Personal Profile with wallet integration that doubles as streaming platform (HeroProtagonist.dao)
The first profile will be a template for anyone to copy, HeroProtagonist.dao

first frame is like a browser for streams, probably just the CCAB. second frame is like my live screen. it has the computer screen and my webcam highlighted to show how going from portrait to landscape goes from third person to first person. third frame shows what happens when you tap the screen, forth swiping up on the inventory. at the top the login would be for either the viewer or the owner. the owner would get an extended admin view. this would also allow for privileged views with specific wallets, live interactions, contracted interactions, direct peer to peer trading and investing.
The user interface we are designing stems from the idea of live streaming first and foremost. Your stream is like a home base, it contains your entire profile including all data generated. This acts a a node for your data in order to encrypt it. Doing basic activities will populate your profile. Things like reading articles, streaming, playing videogames will level up your profile by giving you awards for each action and experience points. Profiles will also be private by default and each individual action foretold will be encrypted separately. This allow you complete control over what becomes public. AI algorithims made through Digiverse DAO will be able to automate the creation of content for your activity. This will include autocreation of short format videos (like tiktok and youtube) written publications, reading list

The creation of the data will be limited to a single studio at first. We will be recording my actions in order to using the video as stock for creating AI algorithms and beginning the process of categorizing personal behavior.

### 3. Voting Interface (communi.dao)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108793241/177531512-81948d3c-e041-46e9-8471-8fc571ddffde.png)
This isn’t really UI as much as it is a concept for UI. voting systems can be manipulated sometimes it’s for political means, but sometimes it’s just for the memes. This is a diagrammatic outline of a voting system for something like a digital constitution. The idea is it would be like a test, a no-pressure test just to learn about one company, country, or community. The diagram is more society oriented but it could be for just one organization, or even learning about one person. In the diagram it shows that every time you answer a question right from all 3 categories, you’ll be given 3 votes in the community. The three votes are split into a structural vote (the makeup of the company) the vision vote (where you want to see the company go) and the passion vote is towards a specific effort the company is making (a product maybe). the more you know about the community the more voted you get. if you were doing this on an idividual bases like my profile, maybe it would give you like comment priority tokens, ntfs of me and my accomplishments. send me comments and suggestions, vote on what project or game i play next. Eventually there will be a pokedex like device that you’re able to point at objects, see the profile of the maker, and add it to your digital collection.

    Cypto operating system
    1. Open Source Linux Distrobution
    2. Designed to be flashed onto any phone
#### Maangled 
### Counter
    Crypto based application store. All programs are open source, awards are given on a credited system. For example, if your studio created a video game, and then someone created a popular mod add-on, your studio would still get the corresponding awards (money, data, etc). Over a sufficient period of time everything becomes public domain. This can also insitivise coorperations to get base products into the market and follow up on them with continuous updates.

## Studios
There’s a growing demand for a sense of communal rebuilding of our infrastructure. With the growth of sustainable energy to meet our informational streaming demands, we are unlocking the power of a decentralized network, one were information from every machine is able to work together to create a harmonious environment to live in. Cars will know to avoid each other, your house may run the dishwasher late in the night to avoid peak hours of electrical demand. Many scientists argue that information is the root of our existence, the ultimate descriptor of interactions of all the matter in existence. Humans are the ultimate creators of information. Naturally, as if by instinct, we study each other and the environment around us. We seek information to optimize the planet we inhabit and yet it seems like there is only more to learn. However, crippling the ability for Americans to express their natural ability to learn is fear of living in the street. There is only like 3 things you absolutely need to survive: food, water, shelter. They’re called basic needs and all three of them need restructuring. Food is an obvious one because giant corporations gobbled up everything that is easy to cook and made it addictive and harmful. Our water pipes are degrading adding lead and other heavy metals into our homes. Homes are so expensive, that they are incredibly hard to purchase especially for someone with student loans and a low starting salary. All of these issues could be solved with good legislation, but many of them seem to be getting worse. All of these issues can be solved with decentralized grass roots efforts. Food is the easiest, grow your own and buy and trade at local markets. It’s actually dangerous for our planet when large areas lack biodiversity and eating all these foods made out of corn and palm oil are contributing to the deforestation of North and South America. Water is a townshed issue. Corporations like nestle are bottling our water and selling it back to us. The water wars started in 1900s when states said you couldn't have rain barrels. The housing market is going to be one of the most complex to tackle. It’s expensive to build homes sustainably and made more expensive through labor shortages and supply chain issues. Efforts to make investing in property easier for people are helpful and create a good way to make money, but it doesn’t chance the fact that renting is a scam are homes are out of reach for far too many people. One answer is middle housing. Construction costs on middle housing are lower due to the larger occupancy on a smaller plot of land, but most of them are rent controlled. We need to see an influx of regular people building and creating more middle housing in order to bring the housing market under control. Many people have realized that they are not on a path to afford a home and choose instead to live on the road and out of vans and trailers. Efforts are being made to take pressure off the system, and there is an opportunity connect all of these efforts through a single pipeline. This pipeline starts by helping people get out of bad situations such as homelessness and toxic environments and puts them on the road to becoming home owners. By starting homes from modular trailer kits, these homes will not only be more affordable, but they allow for the rapid introduction of new technology.
